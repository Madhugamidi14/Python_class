## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans: Python is called as a general purpose programming language because it not just created for a specific problems, it caters to every need. It is a high-level programming language because it is versatile and can be used
to build a range of applications including web services and enterprise applications. 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans: It is a dynamically typed language because type checking takes place at run time. The interpreter assigns the type at run time based on the variable's value 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans: Pros 
1. Open source
2. Enhances productivity
3. Interpreted language
4. Extensive Libraries

Cons:
1. Slower than compiled languages
2. Python's memory consumption and garbage collection
3. Weak in mobile computing
4. Runtime errors

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans: Datascience, Automation, Application Development, AI & Machine Learning, Audio/Video applications.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans: Variables are a reference or pointer to an object. We can declare them by assigning a value to it. Python doesn't need declaration as it is dynamically typed language

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans: By using input() function we can take input from a user.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans: String

Q8. What is type casting?

Ans: To convert a value from one datatype to another datatype is called type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans:  We can take more than one input using input() function by using two ways 

1. split() method
2. List comprehension

Q10. What are keywords?

Ans: Keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans: We cannot use keywords as a variable. Keywords have specific purposes and they cannot be used a variables

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Ans: Indentation in Python is simply the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation in other languages like C, C++, etc., is just for readability, 
but in Python, the indentation is an essential and mandatory concept that should be followed when writing a python code; otherwise, the python interpreter throws IndentationError.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Ans: By using print statements

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Ans: The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Example: +, -, *

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

/ is a Float division and // is a integer division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: a= "iNeuron"*5
print(a)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

a=int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (a%2==0):
	print("Given number is even")
else:
	print("Given number is odd")
	
	
Q18. What are boolean operator?

Ans: There are 3 types of boolean operators 
1. AND
2. OR
3. NOT

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 Ans: True

0 and 0 Ans True

True and False and True Ans: False

1 or 0 or 0 Ans True
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Ans: Conditional Statements are used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program. There are 3 types
1. if
2. if-else
3. nested if-else

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Ans: These are the conditional keywords and are used to evaluate a conditions in the program.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
if (age>=18):
	print("I can vote")
else:
	print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum = 0

for i in range(numbers):
    if numbers[i]%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + numbers[i]

print("Sum of even numbers is: ", sum)
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

a = int(input('Enter first number  : '))
b = int(input('Enter second number : '))
c = int(input('Enter third number  : '))

greatest = 0

if a > b and a > c:
    greatest = a
if b > a and b > c:
    greatest = b
if c > a and c > b:
    greatest = c

print(Greatest of three numbers is: ",greatest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Ans: 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
x = []
for i in numbers:
    if i > 150:
        if i > 500:
            break
        continue
    if i % 5 == 0:
        x.append(i)
        
print(x)
